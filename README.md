# 📊 Project: College Event Feedback Analysis
An Internship Project focused on turning student feedback into actionable insights.
# 📋 Introduction
This project is designed to mirror a real-world data science task for improving campus life. As part of an internship, the goal is to analyze feedback collected from students after various college events (tech fests, workshops, cultural activities) and translate that data into meaningful, actionable insights for event organizers.

The project leverages basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data visualization techniques to understand student satisfaction and identify specific areas for improvement.

## 🎯 Project Goals & Objectives
The primary task was to work with a CSV export of student feedback to:

✅ Clean and prepare the raw feedback data for analysis.

✅ Analyze ratings (on a 1-5 scale) to uncover patterns of satisfaction.

✅ Use NLP tools to perform sentiment analysis on written comments, classifying them as positive, neutral, or negative.

✅ Visualize trends and findings using charts, graphs, and word clouds.

✅ Formulate data-driven recommendations to help improve future events.

## 🗂️ Dataset Used
File: student_feedback.csv

Description: A simulated dataset containing student ratings and text-based comments on various aspects of college events, including the event itself, the speaker, and the venue.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
This project was developed using Google Colab, a web-based notebook environment. The core libraries used include:

pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and preparation.

seaborn & matplotlib: For creating visualizations like bar charts and pie charts.

TextBlob: For performing sentiment analysis on the text comments.

wordcloud: For generating a word cloud to visualize the most frequent terms in the feedback.

## ✨ Final Deliverable
The output of this project is a comprehensive and well-commented Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code for the analysis and a mini-report summarizing the findings.

 The report includes:

   Graphs and charts visualizing the distribution of ratings.

   A summary of the sentiment analysis results.

   A word cloud highlighting key themes from student comments.

   A list of key recommendations for event organizers.


## 💡 Key Findings & Recommendations
High Overall Satisfaction: The analysis shows that students generally rate events, speakers, and venues highly, with most ratings being 4s and 5s.

Speakers are a Key Strength: Speaker ratings are consistently high, indicating that the quality of speakers is a major positive factor in the event experience.

Venues as an Opportunity: Venue ratings, while still good, were slightly lower than other categories, suggesting this could be a potential area for improvement.

Positive Sentiment Dominates: Sentiment analysis of written comments confirms the high ratings, with the vast majority of feedback being Positive or Neutral.

Actionable Advice: Based on the data, it is recommended that organizers continue to prioritize high-quality speakers while investigating specific aspects of the venues (e.g., seating, A/V equipment) that could be improved for an even better student experience.
